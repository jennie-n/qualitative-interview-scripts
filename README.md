The Samples folder has examples of 1) a transcript document with comments and 2) a master spreadsheet with 2 themes tabs and 1 interview sheet.

## First Cycle Sheets
1. Go to the first cycle script. Note that a ucsc.edu email is needed to access this file.
2. Edit the document/spreadsheet/sheet information on lines 16-18 of the script.
3. Run the createFirstCycleSheet function. If this is your first time running this script, Google will ask you for permission to let the script access/edit files in your Drive.
4. After running the script for the 1st time, it will create another sheet titled with the interview name within the master spreadsheet linked on line 17. If the script is run again, it will update the sheet with new comments/codes, and will not change old comments/codes.

2. Edit the document/spreadsheet information on line 3 of the script
3. Run the updateMasterSheet function. If this is your first time running this script, Google will ask you for permission to let the script access/edit files in your Drive.
4. After running the script, it will update the first 3 sheets (All Categories, All Codes, Codemapping) with the new codes/categories/information & add/edit a sheet for that specific interview.
